\arguments{
\item{det}{A \code{glatos_detections} object (e.g., produced by
\link{read_glatos_detections}).

\emph{OR} a data frame containing detection
data with four columns described
below and one column containing a location grouping variable, whose name is
specified by \code{location_col} (see below).

The following four columns must appear in \code{det},
except \code{deploy_lat} and \code{deploy_lon} are not needed
if \code{receiver_locs} is specified:
\describe{
\item{\code{animal_id}}{Individual animal
identifier; character.}
\item{\code{detection_timestamp_utc}}{ Timestamps for
the detections (MUST be of class 'POSIXct').}
\item{\code{deploy_lat}}{Latitude of receiver deployment in decimal
degrees, NAD83.}
\item{\code{deploy_long}}{Longitude of receiver deployment in decimal
degrees, NAD83.}
}}

\item{location_col}{A character string indicating the column name in
\code{det} (and \code{receiver_locs} if specified) that will be used as the
location grouping variable (e.g. "glatos_array"), in quotes.}

\item{receiver_locs}{An optional data frame containing receiver data with the
two columns ('deploy_lat', 'deploy_long') described below and one column
containing a location grouping variable, whose name is specified by
\code{location_col} (see above).
The following two columns must appear in \code{receiver_locs}:
\itemize{
\item \code{deploy_lat} Latitude of receiver deployment in decimal
degrees, NAD83.
\item \code{deploy_long} Longitude of receiver deployment in decimal
degrees, NAD83.
}}

\item{map}{An optional sp or sf spatial object
that can by plotted with using \code{plot} to be included as the
background for the plot. If NULL, then the example Great Lakes polygon
object (\code{data(great_lakes_polygon)}) will be used.}

\item{out_file}{An optional character string with the name (including
extension) of output file created. File extension will determine type of
file written. For example, \code{"BubblePlot.png"} will write a png
file to the working directory. If \code{NULL} (default) then the plot will
be printed to the default plot device. Supported extensions:
png, jpeg, bmp, and tiff.}

\item{background_ylim}{A two-element numeric vector that defines minimum and
maximum extents of the viewable plot area along the y-axis (i.e.,
longitude).}

\item{background_xlim}{A two-element numeric vector that defines minimum and
maximum extents of the viewable plot area along the x-axis (i.e.,
latitude).}

\item{symbol_radius}{Radius of each "bubble" on the plot in units of percent
of x-axis scale. Default value = 1 (i.e., 1 percent of x-axis).}

\item{col_grad}{A two-element character vector indicating the start and end
colors of the gradient scale used to color-code "bubbles".}

\item{scale_loc}{An optional 4-element numeric vector, to be passed to
plotrix::color.legend, indicating the plotting location of the legend in
the same units as \code{map}. Elements in the vector are the lower left
and upper right coordinates of the rectangle of colors
(i.e., c(xleft, ybottom, xright, ytop)). If \code{scale_loc} = NULL
(default), the legend is plotted along the left edge of the plot.}
}
\value{
A data frame produced by
\code{glatos::summarize_detections(det, location_col = location_col,  receiver_locs = receiver_locs, summ_type = "location")}

If not out_file is specified, then an image is printed to the
default plot device. If out_file is specified, then an image of
specified type is written to \code{out_file}.
}
\description{
Make bubble plots showing the number of fish detected across a defined set
of receiver locations.
}
\details{
Data are summarized using \link{summarize_detections}.

If \code{receiver_locs} is specified (not NULL) then the plot will
show all receivers in \code{receiver_locs} including any that detected
none of the transmitters in \code{det}. Although this is helpful to view
locations where fish were \emph{not} detected, the user will usually want
to take care to include only receivers that were in the water during the
period of interest. If you are using a glatos receiver locations file to
specify location for plotting, you will likely want to filter the receiver
data by depoyment and receovery dates to exclude deployments that occured
outside of the period of interest.

"col_grad" is used in a call to \link[=colorRamp]{colorRampPalette},
which will accept a vector containing any two colors return by
\link[grDevices:colors]{colors} as character strings.
